This project is mainly to reduce the wastage of water and electricity. Lack of 
water leads to less crop. More water more crop. This justifies that water is very 
essential in irrigation. The manual irrigation needs monitoring frequently but 
automatic systems can be programmed to turn OFF and, ON the system,
depending on various parameters. Knowing the amount of water pumped out 
for a crop can be helpful to the farmer.
